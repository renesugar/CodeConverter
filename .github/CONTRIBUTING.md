1. Raise an issue against the repo to give room for discussion.
2. Clone the repo and write a test case - copy the closest existing test as a starting point (or look for one converting the other way).
3. Check how the code in the opposite conversion works - there may already be a solution to the problem.
4. Implement a solution. If it involves a lot of code changes, discuss on the issue to avoid conflicts and check it's the best approach before putting lots of work in.

For documentation, prefer:
* Anything process/project related to be visible on GitHub (e.g. these bullet points)
* Anything code-related (i.e. why things are done a certain way, or broad overviews) to be xmldoc in the relevant part of code
* Anything code-behaviour related to be in a test wherever possible

I have a preference for a small amount of good documentation over a large amount of bad documentation.
At the moment there's just a very small amount of quite bad documentation...so my apologies there.
