            The code you submit is not stored in any form. Therefore, please <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/CodeConverter/issues">report errors</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For larger conversions please use the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SharpDevelopTeam.CodeConverter">Code Converter Extension</a>
            for Visual Studio, which uses full project context to significantly improve conversion. It runs completely locally without calling this REST API.
        </p>
        <p>
            The code for this Web site can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/CodeConverter/">Code Converter GitHub repository</a>.
            The client library for the REST API plus some smaller clients are accessible via the 
            <a href="https://github.com/christophwille/roslyncodeconverterclients">clients repository</a>,
            which has a downloadable release of the <a href="https://github.com/christophwille/roslyncodeconverterclients/releases">Windows desktop client</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As always, help is appreciated - e.g. converters for other language combinations. Please open an issue when intending to do so.
        </p>

            This service is brought to you by <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode">ICSharpCode</a>.
            It was formerly part of Refactoring Essentials, and is the spiritual successor of our code converter in
            <a href="http://codeconverter.sharpdevelop.net/">SharpDevelop</a> which supported up to C# 5.0.
